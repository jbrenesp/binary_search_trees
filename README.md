# Binary Search Tree Project

This project implements a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in Ruby.  
It covers fundamental tree operations, depth-first and breadth-first traversals, 
height and depth calculations, balance checking, and rebalancing.

---

## Features

- Insert nodes into the BST
- Find and delete nodes
- Traversals:
  - **Inorder** (left → node → right)
  - **Preorder** (node → left → right)
  - **Postorder** (left → right → node)
  - **Level-order** (breadth-first)
- Depth and height calculations
- Check if the tree is balanced
- Rebalance the tree
- Traversal methods can accept a **block** for custom behavior
